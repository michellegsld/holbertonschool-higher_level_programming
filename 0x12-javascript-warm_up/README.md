#### A directory within the holbertonschool-higher_level_programming repo ####

| File Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 0-javascript_is_amazing.js | Prints “Javascript is amazing” by using a constant variable. |
| 1-multi_languages.js | Prints 3 lines: “C is fun”, “Python is cool”, and “Javascript is amazing”. |
| 2-arguments.js | Prints a message depending of the number of arguments passed: “No argument”, “Argument found”, or “Arguments found”. |
| 3-value_argument.js | Prints the first argument passed to it or “No argument”. |
| 4-concat.js | Prints two arguments passed to it, in this format: “[arg 1] is [arg 2]”. |
| 5-to_integer.js | Prints "My number: <first argument converted in integer>", if the argument can’t be converted to an integer then print “Not a number” instead. |
| 6-multi_languages_loop.js | Based off `1-multi_languages.js`, prints the same 3 lines but by using an array of string and a loop (can't use if/else). |
| 7-multi_c.js | Prints x times “C is fun”, where x is the first argument of the script. If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, then print “Missing number of occurrences” instead. |
| 8-square.js | Prints a square by using `x`, where the first argument is the size of the square. If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, then prints “Missing size”. |
| 9-add.js | Prints the addition of 2 integers, the first argument is the first integer and the second argument is the second integer. Uses a function defined with the prototype: `function add(a, b)`. |
| 10-factorial.js | Computes and prints a factorial, where the first argument is to be cast as an integer and used for computing the factorial. The factorial of NaN is 1 and this process uses a function and is done recursively. |
| 11-second_biggest.js | Searches for the second biggest integer in the list of arguments. All arguments can be assumed to be able to be converted to integer. Print 0 if no argument passed or if the number of arguments is 1. |
| 12-object.js | Replace the value 12 with 89 by adding to a file provided by the intranet. |
| 13-add.js | Returns the addition of 2 integers. The function used must be called add and be visible from outside. |
