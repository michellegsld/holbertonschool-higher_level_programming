| File Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 0-rectangle.js | An empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle. |
| 1-rectangle.js | Built off the previous file, but the constructor takes in 2 arguments: `w` and `h`. The instance attribute `width` is initialized with the value of `w`, and the attribute `height` with `h`. |
| 2-rectangle.js | Built off the previous file, but creates an empty object if `w` or `h` is equal to `0` or not a positive integer. |
| 3-rectangle.js | Built off the previous file, but includes an instance method called `print()` that prints the rectangle using the character `X`. |
| 4-rectangle.js | Built off the previous file, but includes two instance methods: `rotate()` that swaps the weight and height of the rectangle, and `double()`, which multiples the width and height of the rectangle by 2. |
| 5-square.js | A class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of `4-rectangle.js`. The constructor must take 1 argument: `size`. |
| 6-square.js | Built off the previous file, but includes an instance method called `charPrint(c)` that prints the rectangle by using the value of `c`. If `c` was undefined then the character `X` was used. |
| 7-occurrences.js | Returns the number of occurrences in a list. |
| 8-esrever.js | Returns the reversed version of a list without using the built-in method `reverse`. |
| 9-logme.js | Prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value. |
| 10-converter.js | Converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument. |
