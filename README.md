</tr>
<tr>
<td>0x07-python-test_driven_development</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>0x08-python-more_classes</td>
<td>To continue learning about object-oriented programming. There are new special methods: <code>__str__</code> and <code>__repr__</code>. We are really just going more in depth with classes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0x09-python-everything_is_object</td>
<td>Making sure to understand what's happening behind the code and what it truely means that everything is an object in Python.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0x0A-python-inheritance</td>
<td>To learn about inheritance in Python. What happens when a class is inherited and so on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0x0B-python-input_output</td>
<td>How to interact with files within Python. This includes: opening, writing to, reading, and closing the file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0x0C-python-almost_a_circle</td>
<td>Getting more familiar with classes, inheritance, and unittesting. We learn about args, kwargs, and more about JSON.</td>
